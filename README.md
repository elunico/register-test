# Simple Website Registration

This project represents a simple front-end and back-end for setting up a registration form on the web. It uses templating, express servers, sqlite3 and nodejs 
to collect information allowing "students" to sign up for "intramural" sports. This is a fake, kind of toy example meant to be used to demonstrate some concepts 
and serve as a simple but functional "my first project" kind of project. 

You can see the landing page here
